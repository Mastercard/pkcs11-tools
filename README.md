# PKCS\#11 tools

pkcs11-tools is a toolkit containing a bunch of small utilities to perform key management tasks on cryptographic tokens
implementing a PKCS\#11 interface. It features a number of commands similar to the unix CLI utilities, such as `ls`
, `mv`, `rm`, `od`, and `more`. It also has specific commands to generate keys, generate CSRs, import certificates and
other files, in a fashion compatible with most implementations, including both IBM and Oracle JVMs. It is also able to
interface with NSS libraries from [mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS).

Some features:

- support for DES, 3DES, AES, HMAC, RSA, DSA, DH, Elliptic curves (NIST curves, Edwards curves)
- generation of PKCS\#10 (CSR) and self-signed certificates
- import of certificates, public keys, data files
- support for wrapping and unwrapping keys, for both symmetric and asymmetric keys
- support for templates during key creation, public key import, key wrapping and key unwrapping
- support for session key generation and direct wrapping under one or several keys, in a single command
- support for key rewrapping (i.e. key unwrapping and key wrapping)

## News
### July 2023
Version 2.6 brings support for the AWS CloudHSM platform, library version 5.9.
Limitations are:
 - Certificates are not supported by the platform, therefore any command handling certificates will fail
 - Changing attributes values is not supported by the platform; several commands rely on that capability to adjust `CKA_ID` accross objects. These commands may occasionally report an error when executed; key material is usually created.
 - For the same reason, `p11mv` and `p11setattr`  will not operate on this platform.
 - The platform does not allow for duplicate `CKA_ID` attributes, which occasionally brings issues when generating key material. This will be adjusted in a later release.
 - `p11od` command will not work, due to the way CloudHSM handles attributes.
 - When using wrapped key files, `CKA_SIGN_RECOVER` and `CKA_VERIFY_RECOVER` are not supported, and should be commented out.
 - Wrap and unwrap templates are not supported by this platform. These should also be commented out in wrapped key files.
AWS CloudHSM support is disabled by default; please refer to [installation instructions](docs/INSTALL.md) for more details.

### June 2023
Version 2.6, introduces support for JWK - JOSE Web Key output (RFC 7517) on the `p11keygen`, `p11wrap`, and `p11rewrap`
commands. The JWK format is not supported for importing keys.

### October 2021

Version 2.5, that brings support for `CKA_ALLOWED_MECHANISMS`, on many key management commands: `p11keygen`, `p11wrap`
, `p11unwrap`, `p11rewrap`, `p11od`, `p11ls`. Note that the wrapped key grammar has changed; the grammar version number
has been incremented to `2.2`.

### July 2021

Version 2.4, to support templates in many commands: `p11keygen`, `p11importpubk`, `p11wrap`, `p11unwrap`, `p11od`
, `p11ls`. Keys created with a template can be wrapped, the template attributes will be carried. Note that the wrapped
key grammar has changed, and the grammar version number has been incremented to `2.1`.

### April 2021

Version 2.3, that adds extra options to p11kcv, so that tokens not supporting NULL-length HMAC computation can be also
supported.

### March 2021

Version 2.2 is slightly changing the layout of `p11slotinfo`. Edwards Curve support enhanced. The toolkit is also
adapted to be packaged as a [FreeBSD port](https://www.freshports.org/security/pkcs11-tools/).

### January 2021

Version 2.1 brings support for Edwards Curve.

### December 2020

The toolkit has reached v2.0. It features several major changes:

- it supports (and requires) OpenSSL v1.1.1+
- signing commands (`p11mkcert`, `p11req` and `masqreq`) implement OpenSSL algorithm methods. This will enable
  supporting more algorithms in the future.
- major overhaul of the wrapping/unwrapping system: it is now possible to perform double wrapping (aka envelope
  wrapping) with a single command, in a secure fashion
- `p11keygen` can now generate a session key and wrap it under one or several wrapping keys
- a new command, `p11rewrap`, allows to unwrap a key and immediately rewrap in under one or several wrapping keys, in a
  secure fashion.

## Introduction

To build the source code, simply execute (with appropriate privileges)

```bash
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure
$ make install
```

To list the methods available on a PKCS#11 token, use `p11slotinfo`, that will return the list of available mechanisms,
together with allowed APIs.

```bash

To list the objects sitting on the token at slot with index 0, use `p11ls`. objects are listed together with their
attributes;

```bash

To avoid specifying command line arguments, environment variables can be specified for the following items:

|optional arg|description                        |environment variable|
|------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| `-l`       |path to library                    |`PKCS11LIB`         |
| `-m`       |path to NSS keystore (for NSS only)|`PKCS11NSSDIR`      |
| `-s`       |slot index number                  |`PKCS11SLOT`        |
| `-t`       |token name                         |`PKCS11TOKEN`       |
| `-p`       |token password                     |`PKCS11PASSWORD`    |

To extract the value of a non-sensitive object, use `p11cat`:

```bash
$ p11cat pubk/rsa

To see an object's value, use `p11more`:

```bash
$ p11more cert/rootca

Moreover, `p11od`can be used to extract all attribute values from an object:

```bash
$ p11od pubk/dh
pubk/dh:

Generating a key is easy: just use `p11keygen` with the proper arguments.

```bash
$ p11keygen -k ec -q prime256v1 -i my-ec-key sign=true verify=true
Generating, please wait...
key generation succeeded
```

Likewise, `p11req` is used to generate a CSR.

```bash
$ p11req -i my-ec-key -d '/CN=my.site.org/O=My organization/C=BE' -e 'DNS:another-url-for-my.site.org' -v

Later, `p11importcert` can be used to import the certificate back to the keystore. Public keys can be imported
using `p11importpubk`, and data files with `p11importdata`.

If you need to wrap or unwrap a key, you can use the command `p11wrap`:

```bash
$ p11wrap -w aes-wrapping -i rootca -a cbcpad >wrapped-key.wrap
key wrapping succeeded
```

The key can be unwrapped later, reusing the `wrapped-key.wrap` file created earlier:

```bash
$ p11unwrap -f wrapped-key.wrap
key unwrapping succeeded
```
